#### Introduction ####

Many apps out there have rich content with lots of images. But it is hard to find a single app
in which image viewing experience wouldn't be ugly and animations wouldn't be choppy. As Android
user I was very disappointed with this state of the business so I decided to make this library.

Main goal of this library is to make images viewing process as smooth as possible and to make it
easier for developers to integrate it into their apps. 

#### Usage ####

Add dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

    compile 'com.alexvasilkov:gesture-views:2.0.0'

Note: min SDK version for library is 9, but it was tested mainly on 15+.
